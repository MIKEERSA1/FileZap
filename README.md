## Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Store files across a distributed network, eliminating single points of failure.
- **Encryption**: Protect your files with strong encryption methods, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.
- **Cryptocurrency Rewards**: Earn rewards for sharing your storage space and participating in the network.
- **File Splitting**: Break large files into smaller chunks for easier storage and transfer.
- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: Directly connect with other users, facilitating fast and secure file transfers.
- **Validators and Storers**: Ensure data integrity and security through a network of dedicated participants.
- **Zero-Knowledge Protocol**: Maintain privacy by ensuring that no one, not even Validators, can access your files.

## How It Works

FileZap operates on a decentralized model. Users can become Validators or Storers, contributing to the network's efficiency and security. Here's a brief breakdown of the components:

1. **Validators**: They verify transactions and maintain the integrity of the network. Validators ensure that files are stored correctly and that users receive their rewards.
  
2. **Storers**: These users provide storage space. They receive cryptocurrency rewards based on the amount of space they offer and the data they store.

3. **File Splitting**: When a user uploads a file, it gets split into smaller parts. These parts are encrypted and distributed across multiple Storers.

4. **Encryption**: Each file part is encrypted before storage. This means that even if someone accesses the storage, they cannot read the file without the proper decryption key.

5. **Rewards System**: Users earn cryptocurrency for their contributions. The more they participate, the more they earn.
